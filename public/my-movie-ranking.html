<h2>My Favorite 3 Movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</h3>
<p>A great movie with great effects showing magic.</p>
<h3>Deathnote (Japanese Live action)</h3>
<p>An incredibly interesting and thought provoking movie.</p>
<h3>Donnie Darko</h3>
<p>Game me the willies the first time I saw it, but once I watch it 
    late it ignited deep thoughts about the nature of existence.</p>
